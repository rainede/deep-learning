[Caffe Tutorial](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/tutorial/)
Caffe is a deep learning framework and this tutorial explains its philosophy, architecture, and usage. This is a practical guide and framework introduction, so the full frontier, context, and history of deep learning cannot be covered here. While explanations will be given where possible, a background in machine learning and neural networks is helpful.
